## Introduction to building your first Django app

This lab is your chance to dive into the world of Django by building a simple yet practical polls application. To guide you on this exciting journey, we'll leverage the best resource available: Django's official documentation.

### Why learn from the official Django documentation?

Here's why the official documentation is your secret weapon:

- **Unmatched Comprehensiveness**: It covers everything you need, from step-by-step app creation guides to best practices that will become second nature in your Django development.
- **Structured Learning**: The documentation is well-organized, making it easy to find what you need and follow along.
- **Invaluable Reference**: This won't be your last encounter with the Django docs. Throughout your development journey, they'll be your go-to resource for in-depth information. 


This lab serves a dual purpose: it introduces you to Django and equips you with the skills to navigate and utilize the official documentation effectively.

## Exercise

You will be following the "Writing your first Django app" tutorial directly from the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/). This hands-on tutorial will guide you through creating a basic poll application. It's designed to give you a practical understanding of how Django applications are built from scratch. **For this lab, you will complete Parts 1 through 4 of the tutorial.** The subsequent parts of the tutorial cover topics that we will explore together in future lessons.

### Important note:

Before starting the tutorial, we will walk you through the setup and installation of Django in our lab setup lesson. Therefore, you **do not need to perform any setup or installation steps** described in the tutorial. You can jump straight into the tutorial starting at **[Tutorial: Part 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial01/)**.
